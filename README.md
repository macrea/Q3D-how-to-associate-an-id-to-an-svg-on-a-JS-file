# Q3D-how-to-associate-an-id-to-an-svg-on-a-JS-file
I need to modify a qgis2Threejs.js file to give an id to an svg file. The code gives me a query result but I would like to display a simple svg. I enclose part of the code where I would like to intervene. Can you give me some suggestions? Which javascript function could I use? Thanks
